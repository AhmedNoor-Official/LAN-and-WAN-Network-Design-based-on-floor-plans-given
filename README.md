# LAN-and-WAN-Network-Design-based-on-floor-plans-given


You are a network engineer. You need to design a network for this business site. 


Task1 : Design a network based on the specifications and the floorplan below:
 

 

Specifications:
1.	Room 5 should have the comms. 
2.	Each office is equipped with 6 desktop PCs. Assume that all PCs operate critical functions.
3.	In the comms room there is a need for at least one hardware firewall to be connected to the border router.
4.	Most devices should be in the comms room. They will need racks. No rack can be installed in any room apart from room 5.
5.	The LAN has to be 100% redundant in the case of a single point failure. Redundancy is critical. In the case that one of the circuits fails another one must be up. Address this in writing.
6.	The network diameter is not a concern.
7.	In the design include the full 3 layers of the hierarchical model covered in the lectures.
8.	At this stage of the project there is no need for any configuration of the devices.
9.	Cost is not a factor. That does not mean using a carrier class router when you only need an enterprise class router or using a 48 port switch when you need a 24 port one.
10.	You have to consider scalability for the future and address it in writing.
11.	There is an 40 Gbps WDM connection to the main premises of the organization. Describe and include all the equipment that would be present in your LAN only and not in the other site.
12.	There are two 10GE connections that will need to be connected to 2 ISP provider routers. Include those routers in your diagrams. This connection comes to the comms room from the ISP buildings.
13.	You do not have to describe the software needed. For example, OS or VM technologies.


Task2. Design an Optical network able to connect the LAN in task 1 with the main premises of the organization.

Specifications:
•	You have to use the WDM to router model as it is used currently and can be found on the lectures. We practised that in one of the practicals.
•	Assume the topology from the diagram below.



What is required from you (FOR BOTH TASKS):
A.	You will need to prepare 3 network diagrams illustrating your solution. One physical and one logical for the LAN and one logical for the WAN. You can use the floorplan as a template although you have to demonstrate connectivity between different rooms in your design. Ideally you can use Microsoft’s Visio since the networks lab has the software and I can provide you with feedback. You can use other drawing software as long as it can be viewed in LB154/LB216. Please don’t use cisco packet tracer as it has limitations for this design.
B.	You have to provide a written report between 1000 and 3000 words along with your drawings on how your design fulfils the specifications and also justify your selection of the network hardware. Please do not exceed this limit by more than 10%.
C.	You have to search, select, critically evaluate and reflect on the real network hardware chosen for your network designs backed up by appropriate references.
D.	Your solution has to present all network devices, hardware and cabling needed.
E.	You have to use legends as part of your design with full description of your cabling and network devices and reasoning in the report’s text.
F.	There is a number of ways that you can prepare a network diagram and advice will be provided. One of the goals is to be able to communicate your design efficiently in a professional manner.
G.	You need to use appropriate citations and referencing (IEEE or Harvard) for the devices you propose. There are various websites that sell this type of equipment and there are also the main manufacturers that list their products and specifications. There are many companies and although I am very familiar with most Cisco and Juniper network products you can choose any other manufacturer like for example Ciena or Huawei etc.

•	Use the following format for your assignment sections:

Chapter 1. LAN

Section 1.	The 2 diagrams

Section 2.	Design Description. Justification of how your design and legends fulfil the specifications. For example, redundancy, scalability, benefits of the three layered hierarchical cisco model in your design, cabling etc.

Section 3.	Network hardware including Critical evaluation and/or reflection on your selection of the network hardware backed up by appropriate references (IEEE or Harvard).

Chapter 2. WAN

Section 4.	The diagram

Section 5.	Design Description. Justification of how your design and legends fulfil the specifications. For example, redundancy, scalability etc.

Section 6.	Network hardware including Critical evaluation and/or reflection of your selection of the network hardware backed up by appropriate references (IEEE or Harvard).

Further clarifications:

Attendance is essential for this coursework. You will gain the knowledge required during the lectures and practicals. This coursework requires a lot of critical thinking. I have allocated time for every team to get 1:1 feedback and advice on their work during 2 of the practicals. 

View this task not just as an assessment activity but a chance to critically evaluate and reflect on networking technologies and enhance your knowledge interacting with your tutor. Please refer to the table below for the marking criteria.
